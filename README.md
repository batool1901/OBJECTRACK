# OBJECTRACK -AI Object Detection Web App 

This web app performs real-time "object detection" using the COCO-SSD model from TensorFlow\.js (via ml5.js). It accesses the user's webcam, analyzes each video frame in real time, and draws labeled bounding boxes around detected objects. 

### Features

* Real-Time Webcam Detection – Uses your device's camera to detect and label objects live.
* AI-Powered Model – Utilizes the pre-trained **COCO-SSD** model with **ml5.js** (built on TensorFlow\.js).
* FPS & AI Toggle Controls – Simulate performance and model load management (useful in future iterations).
* Clean UI – Sidebar with collapsible instructions and controls, canvas output on the right.


### How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-object-detection-webapp.git
   cd ai-object-detection-webapp
2. Open `index.html` in any browser (no server needed).
3. Allow webcam access when prompted.
